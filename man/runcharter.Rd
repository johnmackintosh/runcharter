\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame or data table}

\item{med_rows}{number of points to calculate initial baseline median}

\item{runlength}{length of run that will trigger re-phased median}

\item{direction}{should run occur "above", "below" or on "both" sides of median}

\item{grpvar}{character vector of grouping variable}

\item{yval}{numeric y value}

\item{chart_title}{title for the  final chart}

\item{chart_subtitle}{subtitle for chart}

\item{chart_caption}{caption for chart}

\item{chart_breaks}{character string defining desired x-axis date breaks}

\item{line_colr}{colour for run chart lines}

\item{line_size}{thickness of connecting lines between run chart points}

\item{point_colr}{colour for run chart points}

\item{point_size}{size of normal run chart points}

\item{median_colr}{colour for solid and extended median lines}

\item{median_line_size}{thickness of solid and extended median lines}

\item{highlight_point_size}{size of highlighted points in a sustained run}

\item{...}{further arguments passed on to function}
}
\value{
list - faceted plot and data.table showing all identified runs
}
\description{
Finds all runs of desired  length occurring on desired side of median line.
Can also find runs occurring on both sides of the line, though this is of
limited use in terms of quality improvement.
Re-bases median each time a run is discovered.
}
\details{
Facets and axis limits are handled by ggplot, though x-axis breaks can be
specified using the appropriate character string e.g. "3 months"
